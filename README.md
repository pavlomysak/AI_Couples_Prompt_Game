### Motivation
Relationships thrive on communication, shared experiences, and meaningful connections. The Couples AI Prompt Game was designed to strengthen relationships by sparking conversations that matter. Whether you're looking to deepen your understanding of your partner, create new memories, or simply have fun, this app provides personalized prompts tailored to your unique relationship.

Traditional couple games are generic and often fail to cater to the uniqueness of each couple. By leveraging AI technologies, this app offers a personalized, dynamic experience that adjusts to each player's input, making every game session unique and memorable.

### How It Works

Getting Started:
   - Enter the names of both partners on the landing page.
   - The app customizes the experience using these inputs.

Interactive Tabs:
   - Complete an Intro Survey together to provide shared context.
   - Each partner then answers their own set of questions privately in separate tabs.

AI-Powered Generation:
   - The app uses Googleâ€™s Gemini 1.5 Pro model for generating thoughtful, relationship-building prompts based on the information provided.

Have Fun!
   - Once both surveys are complete, click on Generate Cards to receive a set of personalized questions and prompts.
   - Use these cards as conversation starters for an enjoyable, meaningful experience.
